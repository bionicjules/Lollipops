A few notes about the ontology.  I have used as many classes as I could find on OBO Foundry. This has worked reasonably well for the plant stuff, but the animal stuff is more directed towards insects and vertebrates, which isn't quite broad enough. I have included the cases to give a bit of background, although the case descriptions were generated from the entire text of the paper. I used a text annotation programme, GATE, to help me.  The asterisk system is merely an indication of how complete the case analyses are. I've put in a littel cross referencing between the biology and the design suggestions given by the inventive principles, but I could make the connections a lot richer. Do I need to? I have also left the principles rather incomplete in terms of indexing them. Frankly I wanted to get the ontology up for you to look at.
