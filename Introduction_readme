Biology is gradually yielding lessons and ideas for technology, but the resulting innovation is adventitious. Biology is also very complex: currently with no underlying analytical model and so cannot adequately be interrogated by technologists. A concept which can bridge this gap is the trade-off, which leads to speciation in biology and aspects of design and problem-solving in engineering. An ontology is described which uses biological organisms as case studies and TRIZ-like terms to define trade-offs and the factors by which they can be manipulated. As an example it resolves the biological trade-off “speed-accuracy”, yielding factors for a biomimetic version of the trade-off. These are Feedback (e.g. error-correction), Dynamic Response (e.g. control of thresholds), Adaptation (e.g. ability to predict) and Consolidation (e.g. stochastic accumulation). Multi-criteria analysis will allow more versatile numerical models to be developed.
The ultimate aim is to provide a problem-solving tool which can be used in real-time by agents. If it can also provide a new way of describing and categorising biological evolution (a distinct possibility), so much the better. 

This ontology (BFO-BMO-git.owl) is made available in the hope that it can be developed / corrected / refined to the standard that it can be made acceptable for inclusion in the OBOFoundry list.
